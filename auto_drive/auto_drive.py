STAND ALONE STAND ALONE STAND ALONE
This script is part of the chia_plot_manager set of scripts.
This is the STAND ALONE version of this script and will work
without needing the rest of the repo.
Script to help automate the addition of new hard drives
to a Chia NAS/Harvester. Please make sure you understand
everything that this script does before using it!
This script is intended to make my life easier. It is ONLY
designed to 1) work with unformatted drives with no existing
partitions, and 2) utilizing the directory structure found
in the readme.
This script WILL NOT work if you are utilizing hard drives with
no partitions as we would have no way to determine if the drive
is newly added.
It can be modified, of course, to do other things.
1) Looks for any drive device that is on the system but does not
end in a '1'. For example: /dev/sda1 vs. /dev/sdh - In this case
/dev/sdh has no partition so it likely is not mounted or being
used.
2) Utilizing the directory structure that I have shared in the
main readme, locate the next available mountpoint to use.
3) Utilizing sgdisk, creates a new GPT partition on the new
drive.
4) Formats the drive with the xfs filesystem.
5) Verifies that the UUID of the drive does not already exist
in /etc/fstab and if not, adds the correct entry to /etc/fstab.
6) Mounts the new drive
7) Add the new mountpoint to your chia harvester configuration.

    This function looks at the entire directory structure listed
    in the path_glob and then checks to see what directories are
    mounted and which are not. It then returns that in a sorted
    dictionary but only for those directories that are not
    mounted. We then return just the first one for use as our
    next mountpoint.
    abspath(d) = the full path to the directory
    ismount(d) = Returns True if abspath(d) is a mountpoint
    otherwise returns false.
    (d) looks like this:
